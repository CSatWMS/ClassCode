1.
initialize
while (condition is true)
	do something
	update

2.
for (init ; condition ; update)
	do something
	
3. 
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) print(i)
for (int a = 0; a <= 4; a++) print(a)
for (int x = 0; x == 0 || x % 5 != 0 ; x++) print(x)
for (int i = 0; i != 5; i++) print(i)
for (int z = 1; z <= 5; z++) print(z - 1);

4.
Mod aka Modulus
Calculates a remainder
	A % B = The remainder after A is divided by B
1. Even / Odd -> Generally identifying divisibility
2. Patterns
	any positive whole number % 2 -> 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1
	any positive whole number % 4 -> 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3

5.
number = A
while (number > or < maybe = B)
	print(number)
	number ++ / --;

for (number = A; number > < (=) B ; number (+-)= 1){
	print(number)
}

6.
have a loop
	if (number % X == 0){
		print(number)
	}

7.
make a counter
loop
	if (it's time to count)
		counter++
after loop, we have the count

8. 
make a collector / basket
loop
	basket += something

after loop, basket has the answer

sumEven:
	int basket = 0;
	loop
		if (num % 2 == 0){
			basket += num
		}
	return basket;

9.
It helps you track what is printed and it's very helpful
	if you miss a step and can verify
A good way to organize your thoughts
Shows values over time
