IntList FloatList and StringList Review.

Answer the following questions:
	1. Why do we use Lists?
		More than one value in a single variable
		With loops, we can access or adjust multiple things at once
	2. What is the difference between an index and an element?
		index = position (of an element) (always int)
		element is a thing/value at a location/index (SFI)
	3. What is the loop we use to traverse a List? Explain each part.
		for (int index = 0; index < numberOfThings; index++)
				A 					B 					C
		A: initialize at zero because it's the first place in the list
		B: condition, until you get to the end of the list
			NOT <= because numberOfThings is not an index
		C: update the index, move through the list
			index++ ==== index += 1 ==== index = index + 1

For each of the following methods:
	1. List the number of parameter(s)
	2. If (numberParams >= 1) -> list data type(s)* and description(s)
	3. List the return type* (void is a return type)
	4. If (returnType != void) -> describe what it returns

*For this assignment, if the datatype could be int or float or String, say SFI.

			1		2						3			4
size		0		n/a 					int 		Number of Elements
get			1		int index/location		SFI			Element
set			2		int index, SFI Element 	void		n/a
append		1		SFI value				void		n/a
remove		1		int index				SFI			the thing that we removed
