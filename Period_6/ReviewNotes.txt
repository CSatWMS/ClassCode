1. 
Initialize
While()
	do something
	update

2.
for (initialize ; condition ; update){
	do something
}

3.
for (int x = 0; x <= 4; x++) {print(x);}
for (int a = 0; a < 5; a++) {print(a);}
for (int z = -1; z < 4; z++) {print(z + 1);}
for (int y = 1; y <= 5; y++){print(y - 1);}
int a = 0;
while (a < 5){
	print(a);
	a++;
}

4.
% = Mod aka Modulus
A % B = the remainder after I divide A by B

Helps make my code more precise
	Find even / odd -> Divisibility (the remainder has to be zero)

	Pattern Recognition
		any positive whole number % 2 -> 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1
		any positive whole number % 4 -> 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3

5.
number = A
while (number <>(=) B){
	print(number)
	number ++ / --;
}


int woot = A;
while (woot <= yeet){
	print(woot);
	woot++;
}
6.
get a loop
	if (variable % X == 0){
		print(variable + " is divisble");
	}

7.
make a counter
loop
	if (it's time to count){
		counter++;
	}
after loop, counter has the answer

8.

make a collector / basket
loop
	basket += a thing
at the end, basket has the answer

SumEven
int basket = 0;
for (int x = A ; x <= B; x++){
	if (x % 2 == 0){
		basket += x;
	}
}
return basket;

9.
table that keeps track of variables as they change over time
	helps identify errors in updating and knowing if the last value is included or excluded
