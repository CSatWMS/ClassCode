Write a function that takes in a color as a String
Use a switch statement to *print* the following results:
	green -> The grass is green!
	blue/grey -> The sky is <color>.
	red/white/yellow -> The rose is <color>.

Write a function that takes in three values:
	num1, a double
	num2, a double
	operator, a String of +, -, /, or *
Using a switch statement on the operator, perform the relevant arithmetic on num1 and num2. Return the answer.













switch (variable){
	case "X", "Y", "Z":
		sout(something);
		break;
	case "A", "B":
		sout(something else);
		break;
	default:
		sout(catch all);
		break;
}
