1. Initialize
2. While (condition is true)
	3. Do something
	4. Update

2. for (init ; condition ; update){
	do something
}

3.
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++){
	print(i);
}

for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++){
	print(i - 1);
}

for (int i = 0; i <= 4; i++){
	print(i);
}

4. % = modulus
	finds remainder after division

	divisibility
	makes a repeated pattern

	Anything % num ->  0, 1, 2 .... num - 1

		anything % 2 -> 0, 1, 0, 1
		anything % 4 -> 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3

5. Counting Up/Down
	1. Initialize a number to be A
	2. While (number > or < B)
		3. print(number)
		4. number++ or number--


6. 

loop
	if (someNumber % x == 0){
		know someNumber is divisible
	}

7. 
init counter (typically zero)
loop
	if (the condition we're counting is true)
		counter++

after loop -> counter contains answer

8. 
collecting

	sums:
		init sum variable
		loop
			sum += something
		after loop -> sum contains answer

	collecting specific things:
		init collector
		loop
			if (specific time){
				collector += the thing
			}
		after loop -> collector contains answer


9. 	table that keeps track of variables as they change over time
	helps identify errors in updating and knowing if the last value is included or excluded
