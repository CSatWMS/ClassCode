Write a function, countDivisible, that takes in three integers:
	start
	end
	divisor
Count the number of numbers that are divisble (by the divisor) between a start and end point

countDivisible(0, 10, 2) -> 6
countDivisible(1, 12, 3) -> 4

what the problem is asking
what our function header looks like?

int countDivisible(s, e, d){}

how do we solve the problem?
